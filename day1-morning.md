Shunryu Suzuki "In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the expert's mind, there are few."

The next time you answer a beginner's question, take a moment to consider how that beginner will feel when they hear your answer.   

Beginners are open to possibitily, overwhelmed by choice. TMTOWTDI: there's more than one way to do it.

Teachers help people decide what step to take next and to consider how people feel while taking the next step. Want people to feel confident. Euphoria vs. despair on a graph.

The unwritten first chapter for teaching: big goals, early wins, in-person connections, cultivate a learning environment

To engineer great beginner experiences: 

 - no "well actually" - don't correct, ask questions and help people find their own answers (from [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com/manual/))
 - no feigning surprise when someone doesn't know something
 - pairing - the best instructors are the ones who have just learned
 - 1:3 ratio - instruction to hands-on
 - regular meetings

Benefits of teaching: better code, better documentation, better perspective

Benefits to society: an informed public aware of possibilities
