## 08:35-09:20 - Closing Keynote - Architect for Wanderlust: the Web and Open Things - Andromeda Yelton

"You built a thing where lots of people can get write access." (C4L)

Why did the web work? 
 - Agnosticism about formats
 - Important thing isn't the information - it's the connection

Libraries facilitate use of info for self-discovery without judgement. Yet so many library systems don't support it. Classification systems. Whose wanderlust does the library support?

Creating software that connects people to the world around them in a way that is inspiring, creative, moving

[WikiEdits](https://github.com/edsu/anon) is library software.

### low-hanging fruit of accessibility

Try using your site without a mouse - keyboard only access helps people with vision *and* mobility impairments

 - Put HTML in desired reading order
 - use tabindex
 - hidden elements should appear on :focus
 - be careful when you roll your own widgets

### archiving the silenced 

Forced sterilizations in Alberta - eugenics movement from 1920s to 1972. Archived stories from survivors. Needed to give voice to silenced without alienating them.
